    "text": "4. Regression Analysis: Predictors of Open Streets Placement\nThe two regression models directly address whether the shared spatial patterns observed in Manhattan and Northwest Brooklyn are statistically correlated with Open Streets placement. Together, they demonstrate that Open Streets are disproportionately concentrated in socioeconomically advantaged and high-access areas.\nThe first regression model examines the composite accessibility index, summarizing access to jobs, schools, and health facilities. This reveals significant relationships between Open Streets and both baseline accessibility and income. As shown in Table 2, baseline accessibility (AS_base) is a strong predictor of Open Street length (β = 793.84, p &lt; 0.001), indicating that areas with greater access to key opportunities host substantially more Open Streets.Median household income is also positively associated with Open Streets density (β = 0.0013, p = 0.002), suggesting that higher-income neighborhoods are more likely to receive program investment. Although the model’s explanatory power is modest (R² = 0.069), the consistency and significance of both predictors highlight a clear pattern: Open Streets are more prevalent in high-access, higher-income areas. These findings point to potential spatial inequities in the program’s implementation.\nThe second model disaggregates the components of accessibility to identify which opportunity types are most strongly associated with Open Streets placement. This determinant-specific regression shows that jobs and schools are the primary drivers of Open Streets distribution. Employment density is positively and significantly associated with Open Streets (β = 0.0037, p = 0.001), indicating a tendency for Open Streets to cluster in job-rich areas. School density exhibits the largest effect among all predictors (β = 38.20, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting a particularly strong relationship between educational institutions and program placement. In contrast, health facility density shows no significant association (p = 0.820), indicating that Open Streets do not systematically align with health-service accessibility. Median household income remains a significant positive predictor in the second model (β = 0.0013, p = 0.006), reinforcing evidence of socioeconomic disparities.\nTaken together, the two models demonstrate that Open Streets are concentrated in job-dense, school-dense, and higher-income neighborhoods, highlighting equity concerns in the spatial distribution of the program.\n\nModel 1Model 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

Equity Diagnostics\nThe quartile analysis further reinforces the inequities identified in the regression models, showing that high-income and high-access neighborhoods systematically receive more Open Streets.\nThe first quartile analysis, grouping hexagons by income (Table 4), shows a clear upward trend of higher-income areas hosting more Open Streets on average. The highest-income quartile (Q4) contains approximately 194 meters of Open Streets, which is 54 percent more than the lowest-income quartile (Q1). Although the middle quartiles display some variation, the overall pattern indicates that Open Street infrastructure is disproportionately located in higher-income neighborhoods.\nThe disparities become even more pronounced when quartiles are grouped by baseline accessibility (AS_base), as shown in Table 5. Hexagons with the lowest accessibility (Q1) contain almost no Open Streets, averaging only 12 meters, whereas the highest-access quartile (Q4) contains an average of 321 meters. This represents a twenty-six-fold difference between the lowest- and highest-access areas. Such a stark contrast demonstrates that Open Streets have been disproportionately allocated to neighborhoods that already possess strong access to jobs, schools, and health facilities, further amplifying existing spatial advantages.\n\nQuartile 1Quartile 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.

This enables the calculation of Open Street density within each hexagon based on the total length of Open Street segments.\nSchool and health facility datasets consist of point-based locations. These points are geocoded and aggregated to H3 cells, producing counts of educational and healthcare service opportunities available within each hexagon.\nEmployment data are derived from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Workplace Area Characteristics dataset.

This process provides a socioeconomic indicator for each hexagon while maintaining consistency across spatial units.\nThe result of this integration process is a unified hex-level dataset that characterizes each H3 cell by three dimensions: the availability of essential opportunities, the socioeconomic profile of the surrounding population, and the level of Open Street provision."

    "text": "With the rising importance of walkability in cities, it is increasingly critical for programs such as NYC’s Open Streets to provide equitable access to pedestrian-friendly environments. This study evaluated the fairness of the Open Streets program by quantifying its relationship to neighborhood accessibility and key social determinants, including job opportunities, health facilities, educational institutions, and household income. Using an H3-based spatial framework, cumulative accessibility measures, and regression modeling, the project assessed whether Open Streets are distributed in a way that supports walkability across all communities.\nThe analyses consistently indicate that Open Streets are not serving as a tool to enhance walkability in underserved, lower-income neighborhoods. Instead, the program appears to reinforce existing socioeconomic advantages. Spatial distributions of opportunities and Open Streets both reveal a shared pattern of concentration along the Lower Manhattan to Northwest Brooklyn corridor. The normalized accessibility index (AS_base_norm) further demonstrates that accessibility is significantly higher in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Northwest Brooklyn—areas already advantaged in terms of opportunity density. Regression results corroborate these spatial patterns, showing that Open Streets are disproportionately located in job-dense, school-dense, and higher-income neighborhoods. These findings suggest that the program’s placement is strongly correlated with preexisting structural advantages, rather than aligned with equity-oriented goals. The quartile-based equity diagnostics reinforce this conclusion: both high-income and high-access neighborhoods systematically receive more Open Streets infrastructure, while low-access, low-income areas remain underserved.\nTaken together, these results highlight a fundamental inequity in the current implementation of NYC’s Open Streets program. If Open Streets are to function as a tool for expanding walkability and improving urban accessibility, future program planning must prioritize the neighborhoods that currently lack such opportunities.\nA key limitation of this study is that it does not incorporate the funding and operational support structure of the Open Streets program, which likely plays a significant role in determining where Open Streets can be established and sustained. Because funding availability and community organizational capacity may strongly shape spatial outcomes, future research should examine how these financial and administrative factors influence placement equity."

The report finds that households living within walking distance of highly rated Open Streets were more than twice as likely to earn over $200,000 annually.
